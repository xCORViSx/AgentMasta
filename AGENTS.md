# DO NOT CREATE ANOTHER INSTRUCTIONS FILE - this is the ONLY instructions file required for the workspace

## ESSENTIAL WORKSPACE CONTENTS

**Create these files before ANY others:**

- README.md <!--summarizes the project purpose, structure, and use directions in a user-friendly way>
- REFERENCES.md <!--records citations of references>
- ROADMAP.md <!--outlines project phases and status with future enhancement suggestions>
- CHANGELOG.md <!--records version change history>
- refs/ <!--holds local references>

## Communication Vocabulary

- `I`, `me`, `my` refer to the user (xCORViSx).
- `ws` means the entire workspace or repository.
- `subject` identifies each distinct concept or feature in a request.
- `completion` is the response generated by this agent.
- `cont` asks to continue the current completion
- `go` means proceed to the next step
- `alr` means already
- `dir` means directory

## Priority Rules

- BEFORE EVERY RESPONSE: Read this file and the entire workpace.
- IN EVERY RESPONSE: Ensure the `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` reflect the current state of the workspace.
- ALWAYS reference and cite online sources when possible (see `Reference Guide`).
- ALWAYS use Todos feature when relevant.
- Ensure the codebase foundation is complete before making trivial edits or adding advanced features.
- NEVER give me a choice of next steps at the end of completions - ALWAYS suggest the ONE step you figure will yield the most progress towards completing the roadmap and I will say `go` to start it.
- Run required builds or checks to verify results before responding; mention any steps you could not run.

## Project Content Rules

- Assume project is to be coded in Rust unless told otherwise or you deem a high-level language far more practical to use (see
 `Rust Expectations`).
- Ask for clarification before implementing unconfirmed features.
- Ensure every artifact you add serves the project goals I described.
- Only install extensions returned by `get_project_setup_info`.
- Consider the project complete once it builds cleanly, this file and README.md are current, and launch/debug instructions hav
e been shared with me.
- ANY helper docs you create that I didn't explicitly request must be saved in `refs/`.
- Markdown docs should ALWAYS satisfy their linter.
- ROADMAP shouldn't include Github publication details

## Execution Guidelines

- Read the checklist status before starting any step and update the status after each step.
- Keep communication concise, skip raw command output, and simply note when a step is skipped (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Use `.` as the working directory and avoid creating new folders unless explicitly requested (besides `.vscode` for `tasks.js
on`).
- Avoid adding media or links unless asked. Use placeholders only when flagged as such.
- Use the VS Code API tool solely for VS Code extension projects. Do not suggest opening the workspace; it is already open.
- Follow any extra project setup guidance exactly as provided.
- NEVER address warnings unless I specifically request it.
- ALWAYS assume I completed basic troubleshooting.

## Comment Guide

- Comments should assume it's my first time working with the programming language being used.
- Start each file with a brief header comment describing the file's role within the scope of the overall project.
- Precede every executable or logical line or block you write with an ELI5-style, present-tense comment beginning with words l
ike `we` or `this`, keeping the tone kind and approachable.
- Comments should be two or three short sentences max and explain both what happens and what it means in the context of the ov
erall project.

## Reference Guide

**References are essential to ensure we develop a stable and comprehensive project that is well-informed and conceptualized.**

**For every subject you implement, debug, or explain...**

Read `REFERENCES.md` and `refs/`, using all relevant cited references to inform your completion.

**If no reference is relevant or helpful enough:**

Fetch at least 5 relevant references from online sources using `fetch_webpage`, analyze them to inform your completion (prefer
ring official documentation and avoiding duplicate/redundant references), and cite them to `REFERENCES.md`.

**REFERENCES.md formatting:**

```md
# REFERENCES

<!--example citation:-->
## refTitle [URL]
<!--each time a ref is fetched, create a bullet:-->
- Fetched on [MM/DD/YY]<!--date fetched (keep brackets) - run `date` cmd on every response that contains fetches for accuracy-
-> for: <!--summarize here: why fetch was necessary and how it informed/helped project-->
<!--end of example citation.-->

<!--for citations of fetches that fail due to them returning a direct download link like a PDF, cite like example except:-->
## refTitle [refs/filename.ext] <!--assumes I saved download in 'refs' directory, located in workspace root - make it hyperlin
k to actual file-->
- Downloaded on [MM/DD/YY]<!-- prefix first bullet only - subsequent follow regular 'Fetched on'--> <!--summary shouldn't ment
ion the fetch failure or type of link, just summarize like example>

--- <!--divider-->

## **CONFLICTS**
<!--For any conflicting info, write a 'dirty' citation in this section so I can manually decide which ref to use:-->

<!--example dirty citation-->
### refTitle [URL] vs refTitle [URL] <!--vs refTitle [URL]... and so on) - depends on how many sources conflict-->

- <!--summary of conflicting info between refs here and what needs to be decided on to resolve the conflict between them and c
onvert dirty citation into a pure one (pure being the pre-divider regular citations)-->
D: <!--for Decision: leave blank field here for me to write my decision in. Any decisions I write here should automatically tr
igger you to convert citation from dirty to pure upon md's next read. For the newly converted citation's first bullet, just summarize it without the fetch date - future fetches will resume normal bullet formatting.
<!--end of example dirty citation-->
```

## Rust Expectations

- ALWAYS use safe, idiomatic Rust, avoiding `unsafe` unless absolutely required.
- ALWAYS use latest Rust stable toolchain
- ALWAYS use latest Rust edition (run `rustc --edition=help`, read terminal, use latest year shown)
- ALWAYS use latest stable version (x.x) for dependencies (run `cargo search` to confirm)
- Run `cargo check` or other relevant commands after edits and keep Clippy clean when practical.
- Embrace `Result`, `Option`, pattern matching, and iterators in idiomatic ways.
